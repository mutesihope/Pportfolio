                As a backend developer specializing in JavaScript, I am adept at creating and maintaining the server-side functionality of web applications. My proficiency extends to frameworks like Node.js, allowing me to develop scalable and efficient server logic. With a strong foundation in database management, I design and optimize databases using technologies like MongoDB or SQL. Crafting RESTful APIs is second nature to me, enabling seamless communication between the server and frontend. I prioritize performance optimization, address security concerns, and collaborate seamlessly with frontend developers. Proficient in version control with Git and enthusiastic about automated testing, I bring a commitment to building secure, scalable, and high-performance web applications using JavaScript on the backend.</p>
